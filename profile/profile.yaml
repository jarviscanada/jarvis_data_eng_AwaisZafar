summary: I can break things down and communicate to any level. I have the right mix of strategic thinking and the ability to influence. I am extremely good at building up and nurturing interpersonal relationships. I have a high awareness of business goals and business organization. I am very attentive to details and am always willing to take the extra step to get things accomplished. I also have utilized requirement elicitation skills in the past to understand all the client's needs and objectives. I am very good at making sure things get done and get done right. I have fine people skills, am analytical, and can think on my feet combined with savvy, computer skills. I have utilized the skills needed for presenting on several occasions. As an investor in Forex and Stocks, I have the basic knowledge of how wealth management works. Because of my graduate degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the University of Kent, England I am well versed in a good range of programming and database skills across many platforms. I have strong technical skills, which although no longer my primary skill are always something extremely useful to have in a bigger team. I have helped me find my way through the chaos that running a business can turn into if there are no systems in place. Therefore, I wish to be considered for a role where I can use my elicitation and technical skills and work in a team setting so I can also work on my leadership skills.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AwaisZafar/tree/feature/creating-ddl/linux_sql/scripts"
    # Please read the project description guideline carefully. Make sure you follow the simplified SDLC pattern. (t.ly/NlXQ)
    # Please include the following keywords: CentOS, Bash/Shell, docker, RDBMS/SQL/Postgresql, crontab, data analytics
    description: The design of the project is based on the requirement of getting the specific hardware specification(CPU/Memory usage) data in real-time from the system and storing it in the RDBMS database. The Jarvis Linux cluster administration team manages a cluster of 10 nodes/servers running CentOS 7 which are connected through a switch and able to communicate through internal IPV4 addresses. To record the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resource usages in real-time, the bash scripts were created in the Linux command line (CLI) to extract the data and then the PSQL instance was initialized in CLI through the docker containers and then RDBMS database was created to save and organize the extracted data into the tables over a one-minute interval which was done by setting up Crontab script. The data saved in the RDBMS database will later be used by the LCA team to generate reports for future resource planning purposes. And lastly, the project was saved into a GitHub repository through Linux CLI.
  
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AwaisZafar/tree/feature/python-data-analytics"
    description: "A proof of concept(POC) project to understand customer shopping behavior for the  London Gift shop(LGS) which is an online giftware store in the UK that has been running for more than 10 years. The revenue has not grown in recent years so the LGS marketing team wants to utilize the latest data technologies to understand the customer better. LGS team hires Jarvis data engineering services since the LGS IT dept doesn't have enough resources to work on more projects. The LGS marketing team will use the final data analytics product to develop targeted marketing campaigns to attract new or existing customers. The project was divided into two parts. First is setting up a data warehouse for Online analytical processing (OLAP) operations which were done by dumping LGS retail data into the PostgreSQL database which was provisioned using a docker container. The second part of the project was to develop a notebook that answers questions compiled by the data analysts. The technologies that were used to solve the business questions were Python, Jupyter Notebook which was also provisioned using a docker container, Pandas Dataframe, and Numpy. The final product was deployed using Github. "
